# Back end for credit card test app

__Notes__
(_Elements that would be changed if creating application for production purpose_)

- No authentication was added to endpoints
- No reverse proxy was added, so localhost:3001
- No middleware implemented, other than cors due to localhost use
- UI alerts were used in lieu of a more sophisticated error handling mechanism
